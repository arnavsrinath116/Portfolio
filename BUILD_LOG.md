## 2026-10-12 · Round 2: less blueprint, slate surfaces, guiding line, one-blob cursor

**Why:** owner feedback on round 1: too literally a blueprint, wanted more slate surfaces, more scroll line animation, and a smoother cursor that is one blob instead of merging circles.

**Changed**
- **Less blueprint:** removed the drafting grid, the title blocks, the SHEET/REV labels, the scale bar and the "drawing index". Monospace is now only for real measurements (dimension lines, plotter readout, frame zone markers). Kept: sheet border, plotter-sweep intro, scroll-measured heading.
- **Slate surfaces:** new slate scale in `src/styles/tokens.css` (`--slate-2/3/4`, lit top edge, layered slab shadow, 14px radius).
  - Hero: a stack of three slate slabs (Product / UX / HMI) that tilts toward the cursor with raking light and fans out sideways on scroll (`src/scripts/slabs.ts`).
  - Work: `src/components/Work.astro` has three slate panels (large Product, plus UX and HMI), marked "Case study in progress", rising in with scroll.
  - Footer: contact now sits on a slate slab, with plain text links instead of mono.
- **Guiding line:** `src/scripts/guide.ts` draws one continuous line with scroll, from the work section to the contact slab. It weaves through the margins and passes *behind* the panels, with an orange pen tip.
- **Cursor rewrite** (`src/scripts/ferrofluid.ts`): a single teardrop distance field (round cone, head to lagging tail) driven by springs. It stretches with speed, snaps round at rest and has a jelly squash on sharp turns; a click sends a ripple. On hover the same body flows onto the element's edge and wraps it (Venom-style), then drains back into a drop. Physics are sub-stepped on real elapsed time, so motion stays correct on slow frames.
- Layout: below 900px wide the hero stacks in normal flow, so slabs never overlap the heading.
- Removed: `DrawingIndex.astro`, `RevMark.astro`, `ScaleBar.astro`, `scripts/grid.ts`.

**Verified:** production build passes; desktop 1440 hero/work/footer screenshots; 800×500 layout; the drop renders as one body at rest. Headless Chrome confirms all scripts run without errors.

**Not yet verified / open**
- The cursor **in motion** (stretch, jelly, wrap) still needs a real-browser check. The in-app browser pane throttled to ~2 fps during testing, so motion couldn't be judged there.
- `DESIGN.md` and `.impeccable/design.json` describe **round 1** and need regenerating for round 2.
- The impeccable finish review hasn't been re-run for round 2.

## 2026-10-12 · Round 1: first page (header, hero, footer, cursor)

**Built** (Astro 7 + GSAP/ScrollTrigger + Lenis + WebGL; self-hosted Archivo + Geist Mono):
- Dark "drawing set" world: slate `#14171A`, sand `#E6DCC8`, orange `#FF6B2C` (all contrast-checked).
- Plotter-sweep intro (once per session, skipped under reduced motion).
- Hero: "ARNAV SRINATH'S / PORTFOLIO", measured on scroll with live dimension lines in true millimetres.
- Header: isometric AS cube (3D CSS) and a [ MENU ] button with bracket hover; hides on scroll down.
- Mercury ferrofluid cursor (WebGL): magnetic spikes, envelop ring, click splash. Menu opens as a mercury flood from the click point (also on touch; flat silver fallback without WebGL).
- Footer: the outlined name drafts itself on scroll; contact links and local time.
- Accessibility: reduced-motion versions, keyboard menu (Esc, focus trap), themed focus/selection/scrollbar, cursor only on fine pointers.

**Process:** 20-question brief with the owner → `PRODUCT.md` + direction contract (`.impeccable/surfaces/`) → build → two inspection rounds → independent finish review (fix → fix → **ship**) → `DESIGN.md` written by the documenter.

## 2026-10-12 · Research and planning

- `PORTFOLIO_RESEARCH.md`: inspiration, resources, recruiter checklist, stack and hosting notes.
- `references/`: breakdowns plus screenshots of Midu (case studies), Igloo (3D/tech touches), Lusion (motion + easing tokens), Heron AI (colours/layout) and Sahor (structure/flow).
- `PLAN.md`: the full site plan (site map, CAD viewer pipeline, idea list, roadmap).
- Design skills installed: impeccable, emil-design-eng, animate, review-animations, find-animation-opportunities, animation-performance, prototype, apple-design.

## Next up
1. Check the round-2 cursor in a real browser and tune feel (spring stiffness, stretch, wrap speed).
2. Re-run the finish review and regenerate `DESIGN.md` for round 2.
3. Fill the placeholders in `src/data/site.ts`: email, LinkedIn, résumé, city.
4. Start the first case study (strongest project) and the Fusion 360 → GLB CAD pipeline (see `PLAN.md` §5).
